Vision-based Tactile Sensors (VBTSs) show significant promise in that they can leverage image measurements to provide high-spatial-resolution human-like performance. However, current VBTS designs, typically confined to the fingertips of robotic grippers, prove somewhat inadequate, as many grasping and manipulation tasks require multiple contact points with the object. With an end goal of enabling large-scale, multi-surface tactile sensing via VBTS, our research (i) develops a synchronized image acquisition system with minimal latency, (ii) proposes a modularized VBTS design for easy integration into finger phalanges, and (iii) devises a zero-shot calibration approach to improve data efficiency in the simultaneous calibration of multiple VBTS. In validating the system within a miniature 3-fingered robotic gripper equipped with 7 VBTS we demonstrate improved tactile perception performance by covering the contact surfaces of both gripper fingers and palm. Additionally, we show that our VBTS design can be seamlessly integrated into various end-effector morphologies significantly reducing the data requirements for calibration.

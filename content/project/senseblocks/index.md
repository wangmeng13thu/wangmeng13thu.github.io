Creativity has many definitions and is embodied differently across various ideation and hands-on scenarios. Developing comprehensive creativity is crucial for children. However, traditional methods for measuring creativity are limited and complicated, making it challenging to support convenient, continuous, and instant comprehensive observation for school teachers. This paper introduces SenseBlocks, a toolkit that enables computational observation for comprehensive creativity development based on a block activity using sensor-embedded bricks. Three variables are explored to observe creativity development from designed brick assemblies. The proposed variables are examined to be independent of each other and can serve as feasible indicators reflecting different aspects of children's creativity process (ideation, implementation, and product). The effectiveness of the variables is validated using expert scoring as a reference, and the results indicate a strong correlation between the proposed variables and expert assessment. We also discuss the potential uses of the toolkit as an accessible solution for enhancing comprehensive creativity development with additional lessons.

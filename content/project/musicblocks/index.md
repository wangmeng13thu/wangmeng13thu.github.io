This paper presents MusicBlocks, a tangible interaction system that integrates multimodal sensing techniques for crafting interactive musical experiences both on and beyond the tabletop. Three distinct sensing techniques are incorporated into the building blocks: fiducial tracking for localization, an infrared communication matrix for reconstruction, and an inertial measurement unit for motion detection. Consequently, the system supports various interaction styles including assembling, moving, flipping, picking, rotating, hovering, and shaking, making it suitable for flexible and versatile musical interactions.

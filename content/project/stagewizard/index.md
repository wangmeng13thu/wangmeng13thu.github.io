This paper introduces a pipeline that integrates multimodal large language models (LLMs) for tangible storytelling, featuring flexible materials generation, intuitive hands-on performance, and easy finalization. The design system enables teachers, parents, and children to create stage elements through natural language interactions and generate paper-cut style images. These elements can be easily fabricated using standard printing paper and assembled into a reconfigurable cardstock stage, allowing children to craft various plotlines through manipulation. The storytelling process can be directly recorded as a short film or transformed into an elaborate storybook using styled image filters and refining LLMs. By introducing the role of the stage in both the design and manipulation processes, this pipeline offers intuitive guidance and affordance for free but organized creation. The flexibility introduced by LLMs supports educators in diverse course design and children in self-expression. Without the requirement for specific hardware, the system also has the potential to be applied more broadly in less developed areas.

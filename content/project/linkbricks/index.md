This paper presents LinkBricks, a creative construction kit for intuitively creating and programming interactive robots towards young children. Integrating building blocks, a hierarchical programming framework and a tablet application, this kit is proposed to maintain the low floor and wide walls for children who lack knowledge in conventional programming. The blocks have LEGO-compatible interlock structures and are embedded with various wireless sensors and actuators to create different interactive robots. The programming application is easy-to-use and provides heuristics to involve children in the creative activities. A preliminary evaluation is conducted and indicates that LinkBricks increases young childrenâ€™s engagement with, comfort with, and interest in working with interactive robots. Meanwhile, it has the potential of helping them to learn the concepts of programming and robots.
